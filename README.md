    - Epidemiological studies
    - Prevalence statistics
    - Predictive diagnostics
    - Survival analysis 
    - And more

In this repository, you will find detailed files and documentation for each project I have had the opportunity to work on. Dive into the world of oncology data with a fun twist as we tackle complex datasets, uncover insights, and contribute to the fight against cancer. Join us in exploring the analytics behind the quest for a cure!
